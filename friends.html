       <p style="color: darkcyan;">The Great Wall was one of the world's largest or biggest building constructions ever. It is called a ‘Wall,’
        because the structure actually characterises two parallel walls for lengthy stretches. The Great wall is the
        collaborative name given to the series of rampart systems built covering the borders of the state or country.
        There are also watchtowers and barracks on the wall. The motive of the Great Wall of China was to protect the
        Chinese states and mark the Chinese empires also. Also built to prevent invasion and raids from foreigners So
        many walls were built as early as the &th century BC, but the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) built the most known
        sections of the Great China Wall. The survey found that a continuous wall with all its branches count to be
        21,196 km. In 1987 it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site and attracts worldwide visitors every year.
        There were so many scholars who said about the Great wall that the construction of walls for security purposes
        is not the reason but its,” Political Propaganda.”</P>
