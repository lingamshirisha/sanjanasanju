            <p>Agriculture provides most of the world's food and fabrics. Cotton, wool, and leather are all agricultural
                products. Agriculture also provides wood for construction and paper products. These products, as well as
                the agricultural methods used, may vary from one part of the world to another</p>

            <p>The primary activity which produces almost all the food consumed by us is known as Agriculture. The
                farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for cultivation, when the soil fertility decreases.</p>
