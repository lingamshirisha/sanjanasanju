    Natural Farming: Anchoring a Sustainable Way of Farming!
    Natural Farming offers a solution to various problems, such as food insecurity, farmers’ distress, and health
    problems
    arising due to pesticide and fertilizer residue in food and water, global warming, climate change and natural
    calamities. It also has the potential to generate employment, thereby stemming the migration of rural youth.
    Natural
    Farming, as the name suggests, is the art, practice and, increasingly, the science of working with nature to
    achieve
    much more with less.


    Improve Yield
    Farmers practising Natural Farming reported similar yields to those following conventional farming. In several
    cases,
    higher yields per harvest were also reported.


    Increased Farmers’ Income</p>
    <p><img src="agr quote3.jfif" width="300" height="300">
        Natural Farming aims to make farming viable and aspirational by increasing net incomes of farmers on account of
        cost
        reduction, reduced risks, similar yields, incomes from intercropping


        Minimized Cost Of Production
        Natural Farming aims to drastically cut down production costs by encouraging farmers to prepare essential
        biological
        inputs using on-farm, natural and home-grown resources.


        Ensures Better Health
        As Natural Farming does not use any synthetic chemicals, health risks and hazards are eliminated. The food has
        higher
        nutrition density and therefore offers better health benefits.


        Employment Generation
        Natural farming generates employment on account of natural farming input enterprises, value addition, marketing
        in local
        areas, etc. The surplus from natural farming is invested in the village itself


        Eliminates Application Of Synthetic Chemical Inputs
        The overuse of synthetic fertilizers, especially urea, pesticides, herbicides, weedicides etc. alters soil
        biology and
        soil structure, with subsequent loss of soil organic carbon and fertility.


        Environment Conservation
        Natural Farming ensures better soil biology, improved agrobiodiversity and a more judicious usage of water with
        much
        smaller carbon and nitrogen footprints.


        Reduced Water Consumption
        By working with diverse crops that help each other and cover the soil to prevent unnecessary water loss through
        evaporation, Natural Farming optimizes the amount of ‘crop per drop’.


        Rejuvenates Soil Health
        The most immediate impact of Natural Farming is on the biology of soil—on microbes and other living organisms
        such as
        earthworms. Soil health depends entirely on the living organisms in it


        Livestock Sustainability
        The integration of livestock in the farming system plays a important role in Natural farming and helps in
        restoring the
        ecosystem. Ecofriendly bio-inputs, such as Jivamrit and Beejamrit, are prepared from cow dung and urine, and
        other
        natural products</p>
